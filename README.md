# Video series building apps with AI tools

Welcome to my app development series where I will be taking a walk unedited through the building of a bunch of apps with Copilot and other AI tools. 

I want you to learn it is ok to fail and how to develop your instincts to succed working with AI developing applications. 

Beginning with simple apps in a single video and working up towards more complicated apps over multiple videos in later editions.

The playlist is available on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpOSdfRllB704xwl8zzZRVcTD71nmHZLc)

The code is in the repos of this org and available for you to take a look at afterwards incase you miss any details in the videos.
